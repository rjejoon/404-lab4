2. A "Congratulations!" page with a rocket taking off.
3. /: 404 error page
   /polls/: A page with "Hello, world. You're at the polls index."
4. Django migration is a way of applying changes made to the models into the database schema.
   We need it to synchronize the database.
5. After logging into the Django admin site, there is a Django admin page with 4 modifiable models: Groups, Users, Choices, and Questions.
   Register custom models by admin.site.register(model) in admin.py.
6. /polls/38/: a page with "You're looking at question 38"
   /polls/38/results: a page with "You're looking at the results of question 38"
   /polls/38/vote: a page with "You're voting on question 38"
   404 error if you don't put a number.
   Use str instead of int for the converters.
7. It is a bad idea to hardcode urls into the templates because it becomes challenging to change urls on projects with a lot of templates.
   If you change a url, you have to modify the templates that use that url.
8. By using Django's generic views, you don't have to write as much code as opposed to when you write the views "the hard way".
   Use the generic views for common patterns used in Web development as they abstract the common patterns.
   Don't use the generic views if you are trying to implement more complex views.
